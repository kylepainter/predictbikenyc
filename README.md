PredictBikeNYC
==============

This is a project for predicting bike trip duration in Manhattan, using New York bike share data.

The project includes code for a web site and for processing the data and creating graphs.

The bike trip data used in this project can be downloaded from this site: http://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data

The weather data is from http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/qclcd/QCLCD?prior=N ; since that data doesn't seem to have a permanently link for those files, I have included it in the data folder.

For some parts of the website to work, you must have api keys to OpenCage Data (for reverse geocoding) and GoogleMaps (for plotting maps and retrieving latlongs).
